## About COSCUP

COSCUP is an initiative led by enthusiasts of free and open-source software, dedicated to promoting the spirit and technology of open source.

### Origins and Mission

COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters) is an annual conference in Taiwan, jointly organized by open-source communities. Established in 2006, it has been a key driving force of Taiwan’s Free and Open Source Software Movement (FOSSM). The mission of COSCUP is to provide a platform that connects developers, users, and advocates of open-source software, fostering the growth and adoption of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) through its yearly conferences.

### The Value of Open Source

Since 1998, "open source" has become a well-known concept, with its success rooted in direct interaction between developers and users. Unrestricted communication accelerates bug reporting and fixing, and when amplified by network effects, Linus’s Law—"With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"—demonstrates how the open-source model enhances software quality.

### Three Pillars of Success

Developers, Users, and Promoters form the three pillars of success for free and open-source software. COSCUP is specifically designed for these groups. Whether you are a developer, an advocate, or a user, regardless of experience level, you are welcome to join COSCUP—the **Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters**—to grow together with the global open-source community.

## Structure and Organization

COSCUP is a volunteer-driven open-source community event. From planning to execution, it is entirely organized by passionate volunteers who are committed to free software and open-source culture, ensuring smooth operations and continuous innovation.
